# StudentSystem
A JavaEE project using Spring MVC, Hibernate in Maven on Linux/ MySQL and also Log4J for logging.
This system has three subsystems: Student, Course and Marks. The login let the user sign-up and sign-in and use the system. 
System keep track of the users who enter/edit data in Students and Marks for future reference. User will be able to see the 
list of items in each sub-system as well as edit/delete features for each record. There is email feature added to both Students 
and Marks sub-systems. The Marks/email would make a pdf file in memory and attach it to the sent email. No results would be saveed
on disk and all the actions would take place in memory.
I developed this project on both Windows 10/7 and Linux Mint 18.1 with both Oracle/ MySQL. But I uploaded the Linux/ MySQL here.
